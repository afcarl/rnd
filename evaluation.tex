\section{Evaluation}
What do we need, what do we have, what is best suited so far?

Using unsupervised features for action recognition is still in its beginning but promising.
The amount of research that has been put into supervised methods, i.e.\ 3d convnets two-stream approaches can boost unsupervised methods when done there.
Big advantage: no labeling, or less labeling needed when using semi-supervised learning.
Amount of video on the internet huge -> potential.

future directions: transfer learning.

datasets too small. Citation: karpathy, large-scale classification: ``From a practical standpoint, there are currently no video classification benchmarks that match the scale and variety of existing image datasets because videos are significantly more difficult to collect, annotate and store.''
