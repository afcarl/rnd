\section{Evaluation}
What do we need, what do we have, what is best suited so far?

Using unsupervised features for action recognition is still in its beginning but promising.
The amount of research that has been put into supervised methods, i.e.\ 3d convnets two-stream approaches can boost unsupervised methods when done there.
Big advantage: no labeling, or less labeling needed when using semi-supervised learning.
Amount of video on the internet huge -> potential.
