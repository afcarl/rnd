\section{Deep Learning Methods in Action Recognition}
Review of approaches that use Deep Learning.

\subsection{Spatio-Temporal Networks}
I.e. convolutional methods.

\subsection{Multiple Stream Networks}
The most successfull architecture at action recognition. They are equally powerful as the improved dense trajectories approach. cite TDD

\subsection{Generative Models}
Restricted Boltzmann Machine

\subsection{Temporal Coherency Networks}
