  abstract = {To allow the hidden units of a restricted Boltzmann machine to model the transformation between two successive images, Memisevic and Hinton (2007) introduced three-way multiplicative interactions that use the intensity of a pixel in the first image as a multiplicative gain on a learned, symmetric weight between a pixel in the second image and a hidden unit. This creates cubically many parameters, which form a three-dimensional interaction tensor. We describe a low-rank approximation to this interaction tensor that uses a sum of factors, each of which is a three-way outer product. This approximation allows efficient learning of transformations between larger image patches. Since each factor can be viewed as an image filter, the model as a whole learns optimal filter pairs for efficiently representing transformations. We demonstrate the learning of optimal filter pairs from various synthetic and real image sequences. We also show how learning about image transformations allows the model to perform a simple visual analogy task, and we show how a completely unsupervised network trained on transformations perceives multiple motions of transparent dot patterns in the same way as humans.},

  title = {Composable, {{Distributed}}-State {{Models}} for {{High}}-Dimensional {{Time Series}}},
  url = {https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/19238},
  abstract = {In this thesis we develop a class of nonlinear generative models for high-dimensional time series. The first key property of these models is their distributed, or "componential" latent state, which is characterized by binary stochastic variables which interact to explain the data. The second key property is the use of an undirected graphical model to represent the relationship between latent state (features) and observations. The final key property is composability: the proposed class of models can form the building blocks of deep networks by successively training each model on the features extracted by the previous one.

We first propose a model based on the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) that uses an undirected model with binary latent variables and real-valued "visible" variables. The latent and visible variables at each time step receive directed connections from the visible variables at the last few time-steps. This "conditional" RBM (CRBM) makes on-line inference efficient and allows us to use a simple approximate learning procedure. We demonstrate the power of our approach by synthesizing various motion sequences and by performing on-line filling in of data lost during motion capture. We also explore CRBMs as priors in the context of Bayesian filtering applied to multi-view and monocular 3D person tracking.

We extend the CRBM in a way that preserves its most important computational properties and introduces multiplicative three-way interactions that allow the effective interaction weight between two variables to be modulated by the dynamic state of a third variable. We introduce a factoring of the implied three-way weight tensor to permit a more compact parameterization. The resulting model can capture diverse styles of motion with a single set of parameters, and the three-way interactions greatly improve its ability to blend motion styles or to transition smoothly among them.

In separate but related work, we revisit Products of Hidden Markov Models (PoHMMs). We show how the partition function can be estimated reliably via Annealed Importance Sampling. This enables us to demonstrate that PoHMMs outperform various flavours of HMMs on a variety of tasks and metrics, including log likelihood.},

In this paper we use the dynamic behaviour of the RNN to categorize input sequences into different specified classes. These two tasks do not seem to have much in common. However, the prediction task strongly supports the development of a suitable internal structure, representing the main features of the input sequence, to solve the classification problem. Therefore, the speed and success of the training as well as the generalization ability of the trained RNN are significantly improved. The trained RNN provides good classification performance and enables the user to assess efficiently the degree of reliability of the classification result.},

  abstract = {Deep belief networks (DBN) are generative neural network models with many layers of hidden explanatory factors, recently introduced by Hinton, Osindero, and Teh (2006) along with a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm. The building block of a DBN is a probabilistic model called a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), used to represent one layer of the model. Restricted Boltzmann machines are interesting because inference is easy in them and because they have been successfully used as building blocks for training deeper models. We first prove that adding hidden units yields strictly improved modeling power, while a second theorem shows that RBMs are universal approximators of discrete distributions. We then study the question of whether DBNs with more layers are strictly more powerful in terms of representational power. This suggests a new and less greedy criterion for training RBMs within DBNs.},

  abstract = {Invariant features of temporally varying signals are useful for analysis and classification. Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for learning invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input signal. It is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal and application of principal component analysis to this expanded signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract a large number of decor-related features, which are ordered by their degree of invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process high-dimensional input signals and extract complex features. SFA is applied first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple cell output, including disparity and motion. Then more complicated input-output functions are learned by repeated application of SFA. Finally, a hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured network can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a lesser degree, illumination invariance for one-dimensional objects, depending on only the training stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training objects suffice to achieve good generalization to new objects. The generated representation is suitable for object recognition. Performance degrades if the network is trained to learn multiple invariances simultaneously.},

  abstract = {Early prediction of ongoing human activity has become more valuable in a large variety of time-critical applications. To build an effective representation for prediction, human activities can be characterized by a complex temporal composition of constituent simple actions and interacting objects. Different from early detection on short-duration simple actions, we propose a novel framework for long -duration complex activity prediction by discovering three key aspects of activity: Causality, Context-cue, and Predictability. The major contributions of our work include: (1) a general framework is proposed to systematically address the problem of complex activity prediction by mining temporal sequence patterns; (2) probabilistic suffix tree (PST) is introduced to model causal relationships between constituent actions, where both large and small order Markov dependencies between action units are captured; (3) the context-cue, especially interactive objects information, is modeled through sequential pattern mining (SPM), where a series of action and object co-occurrence are encoded as a complex symbolic sequence; (4) we also present a predictive accumulative function (PAF) to depict the predictability of each kind of activity. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated on two experimental scenarios with two data sets for each: action-only prediction and context-aware prediction. Our method achieves superior performance for predicting global activity classes and local action units.},

  abstract = {In many computer vision applications, machines will need to reason beyond the present, and predict the future. This task is challenging because it requires leveraging extensive commonsense knowledge of the world that is difficult to write down. We believe that a promising resource for efficiently obtaining this knowledge is through the massive amounts of readily available unlabeled video. In this paper, we present a large scale framework that capitalizes on temporal structure in unlabeled video to learn to anticipate both actions and objects in the future. The key idea behind our approach is that we can train deep networks to predict the visual representation of images in the future. We experimentally validate this idea on two challenging "in the wild" video datasets, and our results suggest that learning with unlabeled videos significantly helps forecast actions and anticipate objects.},

  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00795},
  abstract = {What defines an action like "kicking ball"? We argue that the true meaning of an action lies in the change or transformation an action brings to the environment. In this paper, we propose a novel representation for actions by modeling action as a transformation which changes the state of the environment before the action happens (precondition) to the state after the action (effect). Motivated by the recent advancement of video representation using deep learning, we design a Siamese network which models the action as the transformation on a high-level feature space. We show that our model gives improvements on standard action recognition datasets including UCF101 and HMDB51. More importantly, our approach is able to generalize beyond learned action categories and shows significant performance improvement on cross-category generalization on our new ACT dataset.},

  title = {A Large-Scale Benchmark Dataset for Event Recognition in Surveillance Video},
  doi = {10.1109/CVPR.2011.5995586},
  abstract = {We introduce a new large-scale video dataset designed to assess the performance of diverse visual event recognition algorithms with a focus on continuous visual event recognition (CVER) in outdoor areas with wide coverage. Previous datasets for action recognition are unrealistic for real-world surveillance because they consist of short clips showing one action by one individual [15, 8]. Datasets have been developed for movies [11] and sports [12], but, these actions and scene conditions do not apply effectively to surveillance videos. Our dataset consists of many outdoor scenes with actions occurring naturally by non-actors in continuously captured videos of the real world. The dataset includes large numbers of instances for 23 event types distributed throughout 29 hours of video. This data is accompanied by detailed annotations which include both moving object tracks and event examples, which will provide solid basis for large-scale evaluation. Additionally, we propose different types of evaluation modes for visual recognition tasks and evaluation metrics along with our preliminary experimental results. We believe that this dataset will stimulate diverse aspects of computer vision research and help us to advance the CVER tasks in the years ahead.},

In this work, we propose a continuous human activity learning framework from streaming videos by intricately tying together deep networks and active learning. This allows us to automatically select the most suitable features and to take the advantage of incoming unlabeled instances to improve the existing model incrementally. Given the segmented activities from streaming videos, we learn features in an unsupervised manner using deep networks and use active learning to reduce the amount of manual labeling of classes. We conduct rigorous experiments on four challenging human activity datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for learning human activity models continuously.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an approach for learning a visual representation from the raw spatiotemporal signals in videos. Our representation is learned without supervision from semantic labels. We formulate our method as an unsupervised sequential verification task, i.e., we determine whether a sequence of frames from a video is in the correct temporal order. With this simple task and no semantic labels, we learn a powerful visual representation using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The representation contains complementary information to that learned from supervised image datasets like ImageNet. Qualitative results show that our method captures information that is temporally varying, such as human pose. When used as pre-training for action recognition, our method gives significant gains over learning without external data on benchmark datasets like UCF101 and HMDB51. To demonstrate its sensitivity to human pose, we show results for pose estimation on the FLIC and MPII datasets that are competitive, or better than approaches using significantly more supervision. Our method can be combined with supervised representations to provide an additional boost in accuracy.},

  abstract = {In this work we study deep learning architectures for the problem of action recognition in image sequences focusing on generative neural networks, namely the convolutional extension of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). We first use a stack of convolutional restricted Boltzmann machines to learn and extract features from sequences of images in an unsupervised way, and then use them for the task of action classification. We modify the energy function of the convolutional RBM in such a way that the training updates reported in the literature follow directly from the differentiation of the objective function, which we define in terms of the free energy function. This is in contrast to other works on convolutional RBMs in the literature whose update equations do not directly follow from a well defined energy function or optimization framework without any ad hoc normalizations. We show that the representations that are derived from unsupervised training of the RBMs have very similar or better descriptive power than hand-designed image descriptors and give competitive performance in the problem of action recognition.},

  title = {Review of {{Action Recognition}} and {{Detection Methods}}},
  url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06906},
  abstract = {In computer vision, action recognition refers to the act of classifying an action that is present in a given video and action detection involves locating actions of interest in space and/or time. Videos, which contain photometric information (e.g. RGB, intensity values) in a lattice structure, contain information that can assist in identifying the action that has been imaged. The process of action recognition and detection often begins with extracting useful features and encoding them to ensure that the features are specific to serve the task of action recognition and detection. Encoded features are then processed through a classifier to identify the action class and their spatial and/or temporal locations. In this report, a thorough review of various action recognition and detection algorithms in computer vision is provided by analyzing the two-step process of a typical action recognition and detection algorithm: (i) extraction and encoding of features, and (ii) classifying features into action classes. In efforts to ensure that computer vision-based algorithms reach the capabilities that humans have of identifying actions irrespective of various nuisance variables that may be present within the field of view, the state-of-the-art methods are reviewed and some remaining problems are addressed in the final chapter.},

  doi = {10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587727},
  abstract = {In this paper we introduce a template-based method for recognizing human actions called action MACH. Our approach is based on a maximum average correlation height (MACH) filter. A common limitation of template-based methods is their inability to generate a single template using a collection of examples. MACH is capable of capturing intra-class variability by synthesizing a single Action MACH filter for a given action class. We generalize the traditional MACH filter to video (3D spatiotemporal volume), and vector valued data. By analyzing the response of the filter in the frequency domain, we avoid the high computational cost commonly incurred in template-based approaches. Vector valued data is analyzed using the Clifford Fourier transform, a generalization of the Fourier transform intended for both scalar and vector-valued data. Finally, we perform an extensive set of experiments and compare our method with some of the most recent approaches in the field by using publicly available datasets, and two new annotated human action datasets which include actions performed in classic feature films and sports broadcast television.},
